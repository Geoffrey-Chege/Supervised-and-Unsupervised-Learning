### Description        
* A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog.
* She currently targets audiences originating from various countries.
* In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process.
* She would now like to employ my services as a Data Science Consultant to create a solution that would allow her to determine whether ads targeted to audiences of certain characteristics i.e. city, male country, ad topic, etc. would click on her ads.

### Experimental Design

- Installing packages and loading libraries needed
- Loading the data
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis:
  - Univariate Analysis
  - Bivariate Analysis
- Modelling
- Predictions and evaluation of the model
- Conclusion
